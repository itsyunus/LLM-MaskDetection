# LLM-MaskDetection

LLM-MaskDetection is an implementation for detecting medical masks in images, leveraging deep learning techniques.

## Contents

- `Medical mask/` : Folder containing code and related files for mask detection.
- `.gitattributes` : Git configuration file for handling repository attributes.
- `README.md` : Project documentation.
- `deploy.prototxt` : Configuration file defining the deep learning model architecture.
- `index.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook for training, inference, and analysis.
- `submission.csv` : Example/output predictions for mask detection.
- `train.csv` : Labeled data for training the mask detection model.
- `weights.caffemodel` : Pre-trained weights for inference.

## Features

- Deep Learning based medical mask detection.
- Pre-trained model available (`weights.caffemodel`).
- Data files included for training (`train.csv`) and submission/output (`submission.csv`).
- Configurable model architecture via `deploy.prototxt`.
- Code and experiments accessible through a Jupyter Notebook (`index.ipynb`).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository


### 2. Install dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter notebook
- Deep learning frameworks (e.g., Caffe)

### 3. Run the Jupyter notebook

- Open `index.ipynb` in Jupyter to explore code for training/inference.

### 4. Model Inference

- Use `deploy.prototxt` and `weights.caffemodel` for deploying the mask detection model.

## Data

- `train.csv` contains labeled images and mask status for training.
- `submission.csv` contains sample prediction/output data for submissions.

## Usage

- Train the model using provided scripts and data.
- Run inference on medical mask images using the pre-trained weights.
- Experiment and analyze results in the Jupyter notebook.
